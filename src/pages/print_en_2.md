Today, November 17, anti-war demonstrations by Russians are taking place worldwide, with the main march in Berlin. The demands of this peaceful protest echo those of over two years ago:

1. Withdraw Russian troops from Ukraine
2. Recognize Vladimir Putin as a war criminal
3. Release political prisoners in Russia

Public demonstrations like these, along with the determined efforts of responsible people, made the political prisoner exchange on August 1 possible. On that day, 15 individuals imprisoned in Russia for political reasons were freed. These included opposition politicians who, since the protests against election fraud in Russia in 2011 and earlier, have fought against repressive laws and Putin's regime.

The August release was also meant to include opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whom Putin first tried to poison, then imprisoned, and ultimately killed in prison. Every week, more Russians are jailed for opposing the war and Putin's government.

Oppression and the lack of freedom breed wars. According to the UN, as of August 2024, 12,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed, and 25,000 injured. Millions have been forced to flee their homes.

**With winter approaching, there is an urgent need for support. Putin and his generals continue targeting civilian infrastructure, leaving Ukrainians without light or heat.**
