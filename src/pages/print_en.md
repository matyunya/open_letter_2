We, Russians residing in Japan, are grateful to Japan for allowing us to peacefully express our opposition to the war. This freedom was taken from us in our homeland, and we have been against the war since it began.

__The war has been going on for over 2 years now.__ According to official UN data, **15,000 civilians** have been killed, and **20,000** injured. **Thousands of Ukrainians** have been forced to join the military and died. **6 million people** have become refugees, and **20,000 Ukrainian children** have been forcibly taken to Russia. Cities and infrastructure have been destroyed, and the war has caused immense damage to the economy, production, and environment.

This war is the result of Vladimir Putin's 20 years of rule. The monopoly of power, absence of human rights, repression against dissenters, destruction of independent media, lawlessness, and destruction of democratic institutions have led to this war. The most problematic issue is the massive propaganda funded with millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. **Propaganda is a vile weapon against peace.**

For over a decade, Russians have staged massive demonstrations protesting for fair elections, against Putin's dictatorship, and oppressive laws. However, we have been arrested, stripped of our jobs, exiled from the country, and some of us are still imprisoned. **The leader of this struggle, Alexei Navalny, who gave hope to millions of Russians, spent 3 years in prison and was killed a week ago.** Alexei Navalny's death shocked us all.

Sanctions do not affect Putin. However, because of sanctions, there is a shortage of medicines in Russia, people who disagree with the war are losing everything, and there are restrictions on everything in life. In such circumstances, officials continue to vacation in resorts around the world.

**Nevertheless, despite the difficulties and dangers, we will continue to seek peace. We will continue to support Ukrainians and Russians in Ukraine, Japan, and Russia.**

Sending items from Japan is very expensive. In Japan, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers are working on this, funding themselves, but most of the money goes to shipping. Therefore, donating to Ukrainian and international organizations that support people on the ground is the most optimal way to help.
