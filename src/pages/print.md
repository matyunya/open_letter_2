We, Russians living in Japan, express our gratitude to Japan, which gives us
the opportunity to peacefully express our disagreement with the war. This is the
freedom we were deprived of in our country. From the beginning of the war, we
have been against it.


The war has been going on for two years. According to official UN data, it has claimed the lives of 10,5 thousand civilians, and 20 thousand have been injured. Thousands of Ukrainians died, forced to join the army. 6 million people have become refugees. 20 thousand Ukrainian children were forcibly taken to Russia. Cities and infrastructure have been destroyed. The war brings tremendous damage to the economy, production, and ecology.

For Russians, this war is a direct consequence of two decades of Vladimir Putin's rule. Usurpation of power, lack of human rights, repression against dissenters, destruction of independent media, lawlessness, destruction of democratic institutions lead to war. A special point is the massive propaganda, on which millions of taxpayer money are spent. Propaganda is the main weapon against peace.

For more than ten years, Russians have been taking to the streets in mass protests for fair elections, against Putin's dictatorship, against repressive laws. We were arrested, deprived of jobs, expelled from the country, and some are still in prison to this day. The leader of this struggle, who gave millions of Russians hope, Alexey Navalny, was killed in prison a week ago, where he had spent three years. The death of Alexey Navalny has been a blow to all of us.

Sanctions do not affect Putin. Due to sanctions, Russia lacks medicines, people who disagree with the war lose everything and face restrictions. And officials continue to vacation in resorts around the world.

But we will continue to advocate for peace, despite the difficulties and dangers. We will continue to help Ukrainians and Russians in Ukraine, Japan, and Russia.

Sending things from Japan is very expensive. In Japan, Ukrainian and Russian volunteers are engaged in this, raising funds on their own. But most of the money goes to delivery. Therefore, the most optimal way to help remains donations to Ukrainian and international organizations that help people on the ground.
